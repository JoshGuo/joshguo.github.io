I'm also a member of the Honors College and the CS honors program. \n\nAs an aspiring software engineer, my current goal are to get as much industry exposure as I can get my hands on and I am open to any software related positions. Generally speaking though, I love the problem solving nature that this field offers and I am eager to see where computer science and mathematics will take me in the future! \n\nIn my free time, I love dabbling in as many hobbies as I can find the time for. Recently, I've been learning about mechanical keyboards, cardistry, and playing the piano!"
